## This is my Saatanan Iso Nappi macroPAD with 20 keys, or SINPAD20 for short. 

It is a VIAL-firmware based macropad with a CCCP Missile button as a quirky huge enter button.
The case is being made by Migii and will most definitely not flip over when you press the huge red button.

You can find the case files in the [Case-files folder.](https://github.com/CountKeepo/sinpad20/tree/main/Case-files)

You can find a premade firmware file in the [Firmware folder.](https://github.com/CountKeepo/sinpad20/tree/main/Firmware)

You can also find premade gerbers in the [Gerbers folder.](https://github.com/CountKeepo/SIN-pad/tree/main/Sinpad%20Gerbers)  

I ordered my PCB's from ALLPCB and they turned out okay. I cannot guarantee other that other manufacturers will do a good job.
