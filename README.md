## This is my Saatanan Iso Nappi macroPAD with 20 keys, or SINPAD20 for short. 

It is a VIAL-firmware based macropad with a CCCP Missile button as a quirky huge enter button.
The case is being made by Migii and will most definitely not flip over when you press the huge red button.

### DISCLAIMER, CASE IS STILL WIP, SO FOLDER IS EMPTY
You can find the case files in the [Case-files folder.](https://github.com/CountKeepo/sinpad20/tree/main/Case-files)

You can find a premade VIAL compatible firmware file in the [Firmware folder.](https://github.com/CountKeepo/sinpad20/tree/main/Firmware)

You can also find premade gerbers in the [Gerbers folder.](https://github.com/CountKeepo/SIN-pad/tree/main/Sinpad%20Gerbers)  

I ordered my PCB's from ALLPCB and they turned out okay. I cannot guarantee other that other manufacturers will do a good job. 


### Sidenote: I take no responsibility for anything or anything related to this project lol.
