## This is my Saatanan Iso Nappi macroPAD with 20 keys, or SINPAD20 for short. 

It is a VIAL-firmware based macropad with a CCCP Missile button (KE-011) as a quirky huge enter button. 
The case is designed and made by [Migii](https://github.com/mkylama) and will most definitely not flip over when you press the huge red button.

**Fun facts:**
- The infamous AZ-5 scram button, which caused the disaster in Chernobyl, was a KE-011 button
- After the accident, starting from 1987, all RBMK reactors had their AZ-5 buttons replaced with a switch
  - The reason for this was that the push-button was prone to multiple inputs.
  - In Chernobyls case, the button press had actually registered twice.


## PCB components list:
- 1 x Atmega32u4 based Pro Micro
- 19 x Cherry MX spec switches of your choice + keycaps
- 1 x CCCP Missile button (KE-011 button, check Ebay etc.)
- 20 x Throughhole 1N4148 diodes or 0805 SMD diodes
- 2 x pieces of electrical wire for hooking up the big ass button to the PCB
- 1 x PCB-mounted 2U stabilizer

## Case - Designed by [Migii](https://github.com/mkylama)
You can find the case files in the [Case-files folder.](https://github.com/CountKeepo/sinpad20/tree/main/Case-files)

### Hardware needed for case build

- 3D-printed material of your choice

- 8 x M2 Heat inserts, 3 mm tall

- 8 x M2x5 countersunk screws, aka 5 mm tall

## Firmware
You can find a premade VIAL compatible firmware file in the [Firmware folder.](https://github.com/CountKeepo/sinpad20/tree/main/Firmware)

## Ordering PCB's
You can find premade gerbers in the [Gerbers folder.](https://github.com/CountKeepo/SIN-pad/tree/main/Sinpad%20Gerbers)  

Otherwise you can use the KiCad files to make your own gerbers.

I ordered my PCB's from ALLPCB and they turned out okay. I cannot guarantee other that other manufacturers will do a good job.
