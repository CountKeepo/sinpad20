This is my Saatanan Iso Nappi macroPAD with 20 keys, or SINPAD20 for short. 

It is a VIAL-firmware based macropad with a CCCP Missile button as a quirky huge enter button.
The case is being made by Migii and will most definitely not flip over when you press the huge red button.

You can find a premade firmware file in the [Firmware](github.com) folder.

You can also find premade gerbers in the [Gerbers](https://github.com/CountKeepo/SIN-pad/tree/main/Sinpad%20Gerbers) folder. I ordered my PCB's from ALLPCB and they turned out okay.
I cannot guarantee other that other manufacturers will do a good job. 


## Sidenote: I take no responsibility for anything or anything related to this project lol.
